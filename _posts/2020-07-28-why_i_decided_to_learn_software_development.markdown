A year ago, when I first graduated from Rutgers University I thought that I was going to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. However, I found that I did not actually enjoy the work I was doing. So, I decided that it was time for a career change. While doing some searching for the path that I wanted to take or searching for the so called "next step", I spoke to a friend who is a software engineer. It just so happened that later on I would go on to meet some of his coworkers. Immediately I was intrigued by the duties of a software engineer  and really enjoyed the culture of the industry - the people were very friendly, personable, and were driven to improve their work. 

After this interaction, I started to look more into the the profession as a whole - how someone can become a software engineer, the different types of projects, the different types of software engineers, and the general demand for people with these skills. Also, I decided to take an Intro to Computer Science Course online with Harvard University. It was a fantastic experience because it gave me an introduction to the course and coding (because I had no previous experience with computer science). I found that developing software and watching what you have created come to fruition is very satisfying. Even though it does require one to be fully commited, for me, it is so enjoyable that it does not feel like work.
